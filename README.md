# Rodriguez (V0.0.1)
A program to fix those pesky holes in data received by satellites.

## Key Features
- Repairs Dropped Files from Satellite Images
- That's it for now. Humble beginnings.

## Support (Currently)
- Windows

### To do
- Better memory management. Not everybody has 20GB of RAM.
- Fix issue where output folder is placed inside input folder.
- More command line expressions (verbose, multi-batch processing, colour, dimensions, offset, etc.)
- Create folders if they don't already exist.
- Build for Linux.
- Implement Middle-Forwards correction.
- Implement multi-file hopping. (Skipping to other files if the next or last is inadequate for correction.)
- Implement selective correction.
- CUDA.

# Windows Binaries
- Yes, this is a very sketchy Google Drive link to an EXE. Will it hurt your computer? No. Will you run out of memory? Maybe.
