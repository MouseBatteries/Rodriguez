# Rodriguez
**Rodriguez - for all your geostationary orbit satellite image correction needs!**

Using a custom built Geostationary Error Correction Engine (GECE), Rodriguez is able to reconstruct pieces of missing data
from geostationary satellites. It's in it's early stages now, but development will continue, with new commits at least weekly.

## Documentation

Linux Setup:
- Linux requires one extra step. You're required to make `Rodriguez-Linux` executable. You can do this with:
- `chmod +x Rodriguez-Linux`.
- Then Rodriguez can be run like such: `./Rodriguez-Linux <in folder> <out folder>`
