# Rodriguez
**Rodriguez - for all your geostationary orbit satellite image correction needs!**

Using a custom built Geostationary Error Correction Engine (GECE), Rodriguez is able to reconstruct pieces of missing data
from geostationary satellites. It's in it's early stages now, but development will continue, with new commits at least weekly.
